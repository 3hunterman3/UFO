# UFO

### Analysis

- Utilize JavaScript and create a website that filters various data.
- After getting the data we must create and populate a dynamic table that will be used to display our information.

### Overview

The idea of this project is to display a table that organizes UFO data as a JavaScript Array. This websites function is to filter by criterias and utilize a dynamic website to create tables according to the users desired filters. The table is then created using JavaScript and using HTML/CSS and Bootstrap to change the visual effects of the website.

### Results
**This is the start!**

### Summary

- The table can only be used only if the user knows specific criterias in which they want to look into otherwise the table will not show up.

**Future Development Idea**

- In the future I would like to add the function where the user would not need case sensitive searches and can write information in lowercase or uppercase. 
- I would also like to add more data so that the information is not capped to a certain time frame as we can probably get more information on sitings.
